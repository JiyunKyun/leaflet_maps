# Branch Company Form with Map Integration

This project provides an interactive form for managing branch company data with integrated map functionality. It allows users to specify the location of a branch on a map, adjust the radius of the service area, and persist form data using local storage.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Display an interactive map using Leaflet, which allows users to view and interact with the map.
- **Draggable Marker**: Users can drag the marker on the map to set the exact location of the branch.
- **Radius Adjustment**: Users can adjust the radius of the service area using a slider, which updates the map in real-time.
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Automatically fetches and displays the address corresponding to the markerâ€™s location.
- **Local Storage**: Saves the form data (including location and radius) to local storage to ensure that user inputs are preserved across page reloads.
- **Reset Button**: Provides a button to restore the form to its initial state using the saved data from local storage.
